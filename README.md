# Rock-Paper-Scissors Game Developer Test

## Overview

Welcome to the Rock-Paper-Scissors Game Developer Test. This repository contains tasks designed to test your skills in Flutter, Unity integration, and Web3. You are expected to complete the tasks by **6/7/2024**. The test is divided into three main tasks:

1. **Flutter Application Development**
2. **Unity Integration**
3. **Web3 Interaction**

## Task 1: Flutter Application Development

### Objective

Develop a simple Flutter application for a Rock-Paper-Scissors game where the user plays against the computer (AI) with basic game mechanics and UI.

### Requirements

- Create a Flutter mobile application.
- Implement the Rock-Paper-Scissors game logic.
- Design a simple user interface to allow the player to choose between Rock, Paper, and Scissors.
